About the Catalog App



Overview:

The catalog app allows registered users to create and view categorized lists of items with descriptions.



The Catalog:

The catalog consists of a list of categories in which items are defined.
Items consist of a name and a description and are tied back to a category.



Permissions:

View only access is available to the public.

Categories may only be added by registered users and are unique.
Categories may only be deleted by it's creator.
When a category is deleted, all it's items are also deleted, regardless of creator.

Items may be added to any existing category by any registered user, that is, not only
by the category creator, but must be unique within a category and may only be edited
or deleted by the item creator.
Item may be duplicated under different categories;  they must be unique within a given
category.

Unregistered users may only view defined lists.



Security:

A signon is optional for viewing but required for creating categories and items.
The signon is a local system based upon one's email address.
The user is expected to provide a name (to be used as a greeting) and a password
when creating an account.

Google and Facebook signons might be added in a future release, but will
continue to use the email address as a unique identifier.
